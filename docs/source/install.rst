Installation
============

Installing ``ttkbootstrap`` is easy. There are a few ways to install ``ttkbootstrap``.

PyPI
----
Installing from PyPI is the easiest method, and recommended as it will contain the most up-to-date *stable*
distribution of ``ttkbootstrap``:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install ttkbootstrap

This also installs ``pillow`` as a required dependency if it is not already installed. This library is used to handle
some of the image processing used in ``ttkbootstrap``.


Source
------
You may also install using git for the latest features.

.. code-block:: python

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap

.. note::

    While installing from Source will give you the most up-to-date features of ``ttkbootstrap``, it's also more likely
    to include developing and untested changes.
