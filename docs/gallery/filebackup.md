# File Backup Utility

In this example, I demonstrate how to use various styles to build a UI for a 
File Backup Utility application. I use a `CollapsingFrame` class to contain 
the left-side info panels as well as the output on the bottom right. These 
contain indicator buttons on the right-side of the header which collapse and 
expand the `Frame` with a mouse-click action. 

The theme used in this example is **flatly**.
