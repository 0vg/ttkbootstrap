# ttkbootstrap

A supercharged theme extension for tkinter that enables on-demand modern 
flat style themes inspired by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Features

- [**Built-in Themes:**](themes/index.md) the standard ttk library has included the same
    few outdated styles _forever_. However, ttkbootstrap includes over a dozen
    curated dark and light themes that you can use with little to no effort.

- [**Pre-defined Styles:**](styleguide/index.md) while the ttk style engine is powerful, it 
    requires a lot of effort to define styles for every application. 
    ttkbootstrap includes many beautiful, pre-defined styles such as **outline**
    buttons or **rounded-toggle** buttons.

- [**Simple keyword API:**](gettingstarted/tutorial/#use-themed-widgets) if you 
    have used Bootstrap, then you are familiar with the idea of using css 
    classes or _keywords_ to set the style of various web components. 
    ttkbootstrap uses simple style keywords such as **primary**,
    **secondary**, **outline**, and others to customize the style of widgets.
    This is a LOT easier than using the long, hard-to-remember ttk style
    classes such as **primary.Striped.Horizontal.TProgressbar**.

- [**Lots of new Widgets:**](api/widgets/dateentry) a lot beautifully designed 
    widgets have been added to your toolkit such as [Meter](api/widgets/meter), 
    [DateEntry](api/widgets/dateentry), [Floodgauge](api/widgets/floodgauge),
    and several theme and custom [dialogs](api/dialogs/dialog) that you can 
    customize to your hearts content.

- [**Built-in Theme Creator:**](themes/themecreator.md) if you want to customize 
    your own theme, you can. ttkboostrap includes a built-in 
    [theme creator](themes/themecreator.md) that enables you to easily build, 
    load, and use your own custom themes.
