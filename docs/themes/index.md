# Themes

ttkbootstrap comes packages with a LOT of beautifully styled light and
dark themes, which you can view in a demo by python this command into
your terminal _after installing ttkbootstrap_.

```shell
>>> python -m ttkboostrap
```

You will see a demo screen that looks like the image below. Change the
theme selection in the **Select a theme** combobox and the demo screen
will update to the new theme.

You may also check out the screenshots for the [light themes](light.md) and 
[dark themes](dark.md).
