# Installation

Easy peezy.

!!! note "Version 1.0 - Github Installation"
    This version includes the new API, but it is not 100% finished and is not
    yet published to PyPI. Don't worry, it's coming soon.
    ```bash
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap
    ```

Lemon squeezy.

!!! note "Version 0.5 - PyPI Installation"
    This version does not use the new keyword api. See the 0.5 
    [documentation](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/version-0.5/)
    for examples, usage, and tutorials.
    ```bash
    python -m pip install ttkbootstrap
    ```
