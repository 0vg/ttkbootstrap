## Legacy support

Some ttk widgets utilize existing tkinter widgets under the hood. For example: 
there is a tkinter popdown list in the **Combobox**, and a legacy tkinter widget 
inside the **OptionMenu**. To make sure these widgets don't stick out like a 
sore thumb, I have applied default styling to ensure the look and feel is 
consistent across the board.
