- update meter with bootstyle api

- Create method for updating non-ttk widgets when theme is changed
    - bind an update method to each instance of a non-ttk widget
    - update the widget based on the parameters of the bootstyle
    - the callback will override any style setting defined in the 
        bootstyle, but all others will remain unchanged.
- Create method for creating ttk styles as needed, other than the default style.
    - A lookup should be created to find the appropriate method for each bootstyle callback
    - All create style methods should accept the bootstyle color as an argument
    - Any style that contains an orientation will be built for both horizontal and vertical
    - Build all styles in the default color during Style initialization
    - When a bootstyle is called, check if the style exists, and create if not.
    - When subclassing a style, check that the base bootstyle exists. If not,
        create and then proceed to update the subclasses style.
