CLOSED ISSUES
=============
x Width of progressbar is not consistent for striped and solid
x insertcolor on text should be `selectfg`
x combobox arrowcolor should be the same as focuscolor
x inverse default label style is not working
x fix scrollbar dark colors
x combobox arrow too big
x menubutton arrow too big
x orientation does not work for 'h' or 'v'
x scale dark theme should lighten on press & hover
x refactor scale style
x Create method for updating non-ttk widgets when theme is changed
    x bind an update method to each instance of a non-ttk widget
    x update the widget based on the parameters of the bootstyle
    x the callback will override any style setting defined in the 
        bootstyle, but all others will remain unchanged.
x Create method for creating ttk styles as needed, other than the default style.
    x A lookup should be created to find the appropriate method for each bootstyle callback
    x All create style methods should accept the bootstyle color as an argument
    x Any style that contains an orientation will be built for both horizontal and vertical
    x Build all styles in the default color during Style initialization
    x When a bootstyle is called, check if the style exists, and create if not.
    x When subclassing a style, check that the base bootstyle exists. If not,
        create and then proceed to update the subclasses style.

===========
OPEN ISSUES
===========
- update meter with bootstyle api
x labelframe borders do not show up except on primary (fixed by setting order of pattern search)
x refactor remaining tk widgets with new architecture.
- optionmenu does now work with new api.
- when subclassing from Style, it appears that two instances of the window are opened so that
    when I try to close the window, another opens up immedietly.
- create new style creator application to replace the existing version.

- update gallary applications
    - everything_bagel
    - back_me_up
    - long_running_determinate

============
NICE TO HAVE
============
- bootstyle colors on the text widget
- rounded scrollbar style
- backwards compatability with bootstyle 0.5
